This code solves a set of fluid plasma equations (MHD like) in a 3D cartesian
geomtery. 
The time advancing scheme is an explicit III order Adams-Bashforth method.
Periodic boundary conditions are imposed in two of the three spatial directions. 
FFT are adopted for spatial operations along the periodic directions, while alogithms based on Compact Finite Difference schemes is 
used along the non-periodic one.
Concerning the parallelization, the points of the two periodic directions are distributed among the processors.

To compile the code on M100:
- module load autoload spectrum_mpi/10.3.1--binary
- module load autoload xl/16.1.1--binary
- make clean
- make -f Makefile

Once the compilatation ends successfully, the file turb_rec.x can be used to run the simulation through slurm_turb_rec
