# SCOPE3D
This code solves a set of fluid plasma equations (MHD like) in a 3D cartesian geomtery.  The time advancing scheme is an explicit III order Adams-Bashforth method. Periodic boundary conditions are imposed in two of the three spatial directions.  FFT are adopted for spatial operations along the periodic directions, while alogithms based on Compact Finite Difference schemes is  used along the non-periodic one. Concerning the parallelization, the points of the two periodic directions are distributed among the processors.
